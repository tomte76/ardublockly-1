# Blockly for Kids
Blockly for Kids is a visual programming editor for cheap Arduino parts from online shops. It is based on Google's [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), carlosperates [Ardublockly](https://github.com/carlosperate/ardublockly) and the [sensbox.edu Project](https://sensebox.de), which has been forked.

## Features

* Useful "code block warnings"
* Works online without installation and offline on Linux

If you find erros, enhancement or want to request new features submit a new [issue](https://github.com/tomte76/ardublockly-1/issues).
